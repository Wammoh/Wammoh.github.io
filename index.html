									<h2>About me!</h2>
									<p>Hello and welcome, My name is Troy.<br>
										I am currently working on changing my career to a software engineer. I worked retail for 12 years and recently fell in love with programming. I hope to one day be able to make a full career switch from my current full-time retail job to a software engineer. The journey has already had some bumps in the road but I have learned to see the difficulties as learning experiences. I welcome you to check out my GitHub and would appreciate any feedback or knowledge anyone has to offer. My journey so far has involved reading, videos, Udacity software programming courses, and a lot of trials...followed by errors. This page is going to be my main blog while I continue to learn and document the steps I have taken and to show my drive to learn this new skill set. </p>

									<p>Learning Java with a combination of Udacity beginner Java as well as Youtube "Java Beginner with Mosh.<br>
									I feel I am getting a solid understanding since the basic core fundamentals are based on what I already learned from OOP with Python.</p>

									<a href="project-pixel-art-maker-starter-master\PAM.html" class="image fit"><img src="img\PAM.png" alt="" height="350" width="150" /></a>
									<p>The last project for my Udacity class was to use javascript to create a pixel art maker program. The project itself involved using classes, tables, selectors, the DOM, and events.</p>

										<h2>Text Based Adventure game<br />

									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/Wammoh/Adventure-game" class="image fit"><img src="img\New Project.png" alt="python text game" height="350" width="150" /></a>
									<p>This was a project I completed for my Udacity Intro to programming course. It involved using Python to create a text-based adventure game with multiple outcomes, and different events for the player. Overall the project was really fun and helped me learn to use OOP and helped me get a solid grasp on basic to intermediate functional programming skills.</p>

									<p>This was yet another Udacity Project I created using Python. The project was to use OOP to create a 1v1 game of rock paper scissors with a computer that had different playstyles. This project threw me for a "Loop" with the OOP having different playstyles.</p>

										<h2>Intro to Programing Nanodegree completed</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://www.udacity.com/" class="image fit"><img src="img\Udacity.png" alt="Degree" height="350" width="150" /></a>
									<p>Completed my NanoDegree! I learned so much from the Intro to Programming Nanodegree from Udacity. I enjoyed the structure it offered and the way they challenged me to, "teach yourself to learn". In the end, I picked up a lot of information but I would say my biggest takeaway is the ability to problem solve, and think critically to get to a solution.</p>

										<h2>Gitting good with Git and Github<br />

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="img\github-394322_960_720.png" alt="github" height="350" width="150" /></a>
									<p>I completed my elective course for Git and GitHub. It was hard to wrap my mind around at first but after a few up and downs I think I have a good basic understanding of how it works and what uses it has. With GitHub, I was able to host this page to help me keep track of my progress, as well as continue to learn the process of maintaining HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.</p>
